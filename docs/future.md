## 4. Possible Future Development

* for radar (SAR) images, it is yet to include the complex correlation of the two images, i.e. the current version only uses the amplitude correlation
* combinative use of current SAR amplitude-based offset tracking results with InSAR phase-derived velocity maps needs to be investigated with a better data fusion
* the GPU implementation would be useful to extend
